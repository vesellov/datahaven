DataHaven.NET Terms of Use
==========================

Please contact us if you have any questions: to.datahaven@gmail.com

This is not the final version of the document, we are in the process of developing the working version of those terms.

This license is not GPL, BSD, etc., this is proprietary software. 
But we share the source code of the project. DataHaven.NET Software is written in Python and distributed as is.

In short, we provide most common rights to use, study, modify and distribute the source code of the program. 
We dissallow to distribute modified code, as well as use our code for commercial purposes under other brands or other organizations.

Great Thanks to Richard Stallman, he gave us the right words to use:

+ you can run the program for any purpose,
+ you can study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish,
+ you can redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor,
- but you CAN NOT distribute copies of your modified versions to others.

DataHaven.NET will try to protect users from harmful code comes from bad guys. 
If you want to make changes in the DataHaven.NET code - contact me and send your modifications. 
In fact this is mostly open source project, we just want to keep control over official releases, protect users and do not let 
  shameless people to just copy sources and build alternative platform. 
I hope to build an open society around the project - join us!
